1) Using the program should be intuitive and similar to the example.
   ( Click on the left mouse button and move the cursor to rotate ).
   The four slide bars can be used to adjust parameters.
2) The loading may takes some time. Click on the left mouse button and 
   move the cursor to redraw the scene if a black screen is shown.
3) Object is loaded from a json model named teapotHD.json . I generated
   a new teapot json model that has more triangles and is smoother.
4) Texture is implemented.
5) Environment Cube Mapping is implemented. The object does not have a 
   pure mirror reflective surface. The reflection is blended with the 
   texture color according to concept of Fresnel equations. That is if 
   the angle between normal vector and view vector is greater the surface 
   will be more reflective. So reflection is more obvious at the edge.
6) The program also implement image based lighting. The diffuse light 
   and specular light coefficient is stored in two separate cubemaps 
   and are looked up in shader.
