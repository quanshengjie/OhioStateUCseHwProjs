Using the application is intuitive

loop $ will jump back to itself everytime reach it and decrement exa, 
the loop will continue until eax register reach zero. The purpose of loop $
is to pause the program for a will so that the application can mimic the 
effect of shark moving toward left gradually rather than finish all actions
in an extremely short time.

The first time jnz.p excuted, esi = 0x15 
The second time jnz.p excuted, esi = 0x14 
Immediately before the final int 0x80 excuted, esi = 0x0 
The function of register esi is to count the times that jnz .p excuted which
is the times of looping.
