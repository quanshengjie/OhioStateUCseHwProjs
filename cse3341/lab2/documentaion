1) The interpreter is implemented using OO design approach. Each non-terminal
   is contained in a seperate class. The name of class that corresponding to each 
   non-terminal should be self-explanatory. A class that store the value of 
   variables is passed though the entire parse tree.
2) The instructions of compiling and running are sepecified in detail in 
   README.

3) The files included in data folder are all tested programs.
   Note: not all test programs are legal.
