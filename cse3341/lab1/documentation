1) The Tokenizer class contain four public methods, getToken(), skipToken(),
   intVal(), idName(). There function are the same as described in the 
   slides. The class uses regular expression to extract the legal token at 
   the head of the program stream. The current token is cached. The cache 
   will be enjoied by getToken() method. skipToken() will update the cached
   token information and move cursor forward in the program stream. The 
   Tokenizer class also keep track weather there was a space between current
   token and the previous token so that the whitespace requirement can be 
   enforced.

2) The instructions of compiling and running are sepecified in detail in 
   README.

3) The files included in data folder are all tested programs.
   Note: testProgram3 and testProgram5 are for illegal tokens. All others 
   are legal tokens.

4) No known bugs.
