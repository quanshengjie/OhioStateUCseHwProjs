The code included in the files ftps.py and ftpc.py are well documented and 
self-explanatory. ftps.py is the server and ftpc.py is the client. The program 
runs under python 3 and can be run using the command sepecified in the lab2 
instruction document. All files received by the server will be stored in the 
recv directory in the same path as the ftps.py.
